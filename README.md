The NEAT-AI-Dodge-Simulation project is a dynamic showcase of NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT). This simulation provides a platform for training intelligent "players" to master the skill of dodging enemies. Using the NEAT algorithm, the agents evolve and adapt their neural network structures to navigate a challenging environment successfully. The project invites enthusiasts to explore the codebase, experiment with parameters, and observe the fascinating process of AI evolution in real-time.
